# EUROToken concept

A EUROtoken is a token whose value is tied to being exactly 1 EURO.

This is accomplished by buying gold when eurotokens are created for the value of the amount of tokens to be created and at the same time a short position euro/gold is opened.

When the gold price drops, the short covers the loss so the eurotoken is still backed by the same value.

If the gold price drops below 90% of the eurotoken supply, the short is closed, extra gold is bought and a new short position is opened.
This ensuresthat the goldtoken is always backed by at least 90% in gold and is not completely covered by shorts in the financial system.

If the gold price rises more than 10%, gold may be sold to cover the loss on the short positions after which new short positions are opened.
